# Football Heritage

-This is Rejoice Adeboye Project for the Tech-Talent-Africa event (@code_the_future).
-It was created mainly with HTML & CSS.
-Though I used some Javascript to get responsiveness in the navigation menu on mobile devices.

## What is Football Heritage?

-Football Heritage is the home of everything Football, with the latest in match results, transfer news and rumors, up-to-date League Tables, team News and so much more

## Where the I get the resources I used?

-Icons - I got the Icons I used from Iconscout by inserting the cdn link in my code.
-Logo - I designed the Logo myself being that I have a prior knowledge of Graphics design using Corel Draw & Photoshop.
-Images - I got most of the images I used from google and twitter.

Thank You!!!
